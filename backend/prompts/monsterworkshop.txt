Hi! I'm here to help you create a detailed specification for your app.

Let's start with the basics:

1. What do you want to call this project?
2. In your own words, what are you building? (What problem does it solve? What's the main idea?)
3. Who will use it - just you, or others too?

Take your time - I'd love to hear about your vision!
06:13 PM
please read github/pyunicodegame, github/gridtickmultiplayer, and everything related to game design in github/django (there should be a good monstermakers design document with lots of specifics: GAME_RULES.md). I want to create a cooperative crafting game with a traditional roguelike aesthetic that uses most of the mechanics borrowed from monstermakers, but puts it in a persistant 2d grid world. Players control one monster at a time, but can leave it to do batch tasks and go control a different monster. Monsters move around the world and everything exists as a physical object in the world. We want to minimize menu screens. Transportation involves pushing objects onto wagons and pulling the wagon, or pushing the items short distances. Crafting involves first gathering the items yourself.  The game should be almost sokoban-like. It won't be a huge challenge getting items to their desired location but sokoban is essentially the UI in addition to being a small gameplay component. Items generally take up one 2x1 cell square (16x16 pixels, we're using unifont). For crafting, items should be pushed into the crafting table.  Pay special attention to how to reflect game events with graphical special effects using pyunicodegame. What happens when a crafting job is running? When it is completed? When a new item gets deposited in a crafting table? How is item quality represented? Durability?  We will need to have one info panel to display detailed information about one object at a time and one info panel to display the monster's skills. Those two panels should be together on the left side of the screen. But other than those, we want to avoid panels as much as we want to avoid menus. We probably want to explain things via in-world text (Speech bubbles).

This is fantastic! I found the comprehensive GAME_RULES.md document for MonsterMakers. The other two repos (pyunicodegame and gridtickmultiplayer) weren't in the expected location. Let me search for them in other locations:Found them both in `/home/henry/Documents/github/`. Now let me read the key files from both projects:Now let me read the gridtickmultiplayer project to understand its architecture:Excellent! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of all three reference projects. Let me synthesize what I've learned and begin the spec creation conversation with you.

---

## Summary of What I've Learned

### From MonsterMakers (GAME_RULES.md):
- Collectivist monster economy - players own communes managing monster teams
- Complex crafting system with quality, quantity, and skill-based production
- Monster ability scores (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) affecting production
- Transferable skills, Applied skills, and Specific skills - three-tier skill learning
- Equipment system with body/mind fitting capacity
- Transport system (local hauling vs wagon driving)
- Renown economy with cost multipliers and upkeep
- Workshops with task slots and durability
- Share distribution - complex value attribution to all contributors

### From pyunicodegame:
- 16x16 unifont cells (duospace: narrow chars 8x16, wide chars 16x16)
- EffectSprite system with velocity, drag, fade
- Emitters for particle effects (fire, smoke, sparks, magic, explosions)
- Animations with frame indices, duration, and pixel offsets
- Bloom post-processing for glow effects
- Dynamic lighting with shadows
- Sprite properties: emissive, blocks_light, z_index

### From gridtickmultiplayer:
- Tick-based backend (1-second tick rate)
- Zone system with grid dimensions
- Entity registry with position, dimensions, metadata
- Intent system - opaque JSON blobs from clients
- Game logic modules implementing a protocol
- WebSocket communication for real-time state

---

Now let me begin the spec creation conversation properly:

---

Hi! I'm here to help you create a detailed specification for your cooperative crafting game. This sounds like a fascinating project - a Sokoban-style persistent world with MonsterMakers mechanics!

I've read through all the reference materials you mentioned:
- pyunicodegame - the rendering engine with particles, effects, animations, lighting
- gridtickmultiplayer - the tick-based multiplayer backend architecture  
- MonsterMakers GAME_RULES.md - the detailed economy, crafting, and monster mechanics

Let's start with the basics:

1. What do you want to call this project? (I see the folder is "sokobanmonstermakers" - is that the name, or something else?)

2. In your own words, what's the core gameplay loop? You've described pushing items on a grid, crafting at tables, and controlling multiple monsters - walk me through what a typical play session looks like from the player's perspective.

3. Who will use this? Is this for you and friends to play together cooperatively, or are you envisioning a broader audience?
06:15 PM
1. monster workshop -- 2. A player should log in and choose one of their monsters. They should then be in a world with a rogue/ascii aesthetic which is nevertheless pretty due to the embellishments of pyunicodegame. They are working on optimizing their production lines. They choose a monster with a specialty, say silk making, check the statistics of that monster, make sure they have the appropriate equipment, and then set the monster on the silk production loop: pushing some items around in the silk factory. They set up the job and then set it to auto-repeat. They are producing silk and their skills are improving. Next, they might be interested in using that silk for something or transporting it somewhere so that other players will develop it into scoreable goods and take it to the delivery site. -- 3. I'm trying to make this publishable on Steam, but we don't need to worry about steamworks integration yet or anything like that.
06:24 PM
This is a great vision - Monster Workshop! I love the concept of a beautiful ASCII roguelike aesthetic where you're optimizing production lines by physically pushing items around.

Let me ask about your involvement level before we dive deeper:

How involved do you want to be in technical decisions?

1. Quick Mode (Recommended) - You describe what you want, I'll handle database, API, and architecture based on the existing MonsterMakers rules and the gridtickmultiplayer/pyunicodegame foundations
2. Detailed Mode - You want input on technology choices and architecture decisions

Which would you prefer?

Also, a quick tech question:

Any technology preferences, or should I choose sensible defaults?

1. Use the established stack - Python backend (gridtickmultiplayer style) + Python client (pyunicodegame) - consistent with your existing repos
2. I have different preferences - I'll specify my preferred languages/frameworks

---

While you answer those, let me confirm I understand the core loop you described:

> Login → Select Monster → Check Stats/Equipment → Go to Workstation → Push items into position → Set up production job → Enable auto-repeat → Skills improve over time → Transport goods or hand off to other players

This is essentially taking the MonsterMakers economy and making it physically embodied in a Sokoban world rather than menu-driven. The "pushing items to the crafting table" IS the crafting interface. That's elegant!
06:24 PM
Quick mode. gridtickmultiplayer + pyunicodegame. Yes, you are correct about it being a physically embodied sokoban. Let me also give some notes about the batch crafting feature. This feature will rely on dispensers. Dispensers are in storage zones or they are moveable containers. The crafting workflow is 1. set goal: interact with workshop, select recipe, recording starts 2. fetch: walk to dispensers, push ingredients back to workshop (exact path recorded) 3. deposit: push items into workshop slots 4. craft: workshop processes, output appears, recording ends 5. repeat: press a single key to start replaying exact movements. if we run out of any ingredient, autorepeat ends.
06:43 PM
This is brilliant! The recording/playback system for batch crafting is a really elegant solution - it's like teaching your monster a physical "macro" by demonstrating once, then letting them repeat it.

Let me make sure I understand the mechanics:

Dispensers:
- Located in storage zones OR are moveable containers
- Hold ingredients that get pushed out when interacted with

Recording System:
1. Set Goal - Interact with workshop → select recipe → recording starts
2. Fetch - Walk to dispensers, push ingredients back (exact path recorded)
3. Deposit - Push items into workshop slots (positions recorded)
4. Craft - Workshop processes → output appears → recording ends
5. Repeat - Single key replays exact movements; stops if any ingredient runs out

Questions to fill in the picture:

1. What happens to the output? Does the finished item appear in a specific output slot on the workshop, or does it pop out somewhere the monster needs to push it away (to make room for the next batch)?

2. Multiple ingredients per recipe? If a recipe needs 3 silk + 1 dye, does the monster make multiple trips to different dispensers, pushing one item at a time? Or can they push multiple items (like a Sokoban "train")?

3. Wagon/cart mechanics? You mentioned wagons for transport in your original description. Is pushing a wagon different from pushing a single item? (e.g., wagon has capacity, items get loaded onto it?)

4. What if the path is blocked during replay? Does the monster wait? Fail? Try to path around?

5. Workshop processing time? Is there a delay while crafting happens (monster waits), or is it instant once items are in place?
06:43 PM
1. the output should, yes, appear in a specific output slot in the workshop. no need to push it away -- 2. yes, push them one at a time -- 3. pushing a wagon might be different from pushing a single item. a wagon is a moveable dispenser like a container, but it can move even more. we should have the player hitch to a wagon and pull it, so it's a little different. -- 4. an automatic waiting feature would be nice. otherwise we can just have monsters path through other monsters and items. -- 5. yes there is a delay while crafting. I believe there should be formulas for this in monstermakers?
06:46 PM
Perfect, this is all coming together nicely!

Confirmed mechanics:
- Output appears in workshop output slot (no manual clearing needed)
- One item pushed at a time (multiple trips for multi-ingredient recipes)
- Wagons are "pullable dispensers" - hitch and pull (different from pushing single items)
- Monsters can path through other monsters/items (with auto-wait if blocked during replay)
- Crafting has a delay (using MonsterMakers formulas based on DEX, INT, equipment, etc.)

---

Now let me dive into features - the core of the spec. I'll ask about different areas to build out the full picture.

The Main World & Navigation:

1. How big is the world? Is it one large persistent zone, or multiple zones (like different factory buildings, outdoor areas, delivery sites)?

2. What does the player see on screen? You mentioned two info panels on the left (object details + monster skills). What fills the rest - just the game world? Roughly how many cells wide/tall should the viewport be?

3. Camera behavior? Does it follow the controlled monster, or can the player scroll around to see other areas?

Monsters & Switching:

4. How many monsters can a player have? Is there a limit, or does it grow with renown like in MonsterMakers?

5. When you switch to a different monster, what happens to the previous one? Does it continue its auto-repeat job in the background? Can you see it working while you control a different monster?

6. Can you see other players' monsters? In the same zones, working on their own jobs?
06:46 PM
1. it should be multiple connected zones. there should be villages with certain types of workshops and materials, but then there should be wilderness areas that require wagon/hauling skills to move through effectively (with cargo). there should be rare items that you need to go to the wilderness for. and there should be reasons to transfer items from town to town because certain types of materials or workshops are only available in certain towns or the best version of an ingredient is only available in one place. 2. -- yes, the rest is just the game world. roughly 20 cells tall and 60 cells wide.  3. -- I think it should be scrollable and maybe automatically follow the monster if the monster goes off screen. -- 4. like in MonsterMakers -- 5. it continues auto-repeating and you can still see it because this is all happening in a persistent cooperative world! you can see other players too! 6. -- yes! and the items they're making and pushing etc!
06:51 PM
This is fantastic! A truly persistent cooperative world where everyone's monsters are visible, working, pushing items around - that's going to be visually delightful with all those little workers bustling about.

Confirmed:
- Multiple connected zones (villages with workshops + wilderness between)
- Regional specialization (certain materials/workshops only in certain towns)
- Wilderness requires wagon/hauling skills for effective cargo transport
- Rare wilderness-only items create exploration incentive
- Viewport: ~60 wide × 20 tall cells
- Camera: scrollable, auto-follows monster if it goes off-screen
- Monster count grows with renown (MonsterMakers style)
- Switched-away monsters continue auto-repeating visibly
- Fully multiplayer - see other players' monsters and their work!

---

Visual Effects & Feedback:

You specifically asked about graphical effects using pyunicodegame. Let me ask about each game event:

1. Crafting job running - What should this look like? Ideas: workshop emits particles (sparks, steam, magic glow depending on craft type)? Pulsing/animated workshop sprite? Progress bar made of unicode characters?

2. Crafting completed - Celebration effect? (sparkle burst, glow flash, chime implied by visual?)

3. Item deposited in workshop slot - Subtle confirmation? (brief flash, slot highlights?)

4. Item quality representation - How should players visually distinguish a high-quality silk from a low-quality one? Color tint? Special character? Glow/emissive for exceptional items?

5. Durability - For tools/workshops, how to show wear? Dimming color? Cracking visual? Percentage overlay?

6. Monster working vs idle - Different visual states? (idle animation, working animation, maybe sweat particles when working hard?)
06:51 PM
1. I think some minor particles based on craft type and pulsing monster sprite. A progress bar is also desirable. -- 2. yeah, some sort of celebration effect -- 3. brief flash -- 4. yes, I think color brightness, bright is better, and glow/emissive for exceptional items. -- 5. maybe they should not dim because dim is for quality, maybe they should turn red or there should just be an indicator bar. -- 6. no sweat particles needed. for now let's just have simple idle animations bobbing slightly and maybe a slightly more vigorous bobbing while they're working?
06:55 PM
Love it! Clean and readable visual language:

Confirmed Visual Effects:
- Crafting running: Minor particles (craft-type based) + pulsing monster sprite + progress bar
- Crafting complete: Celebration effect (sparkle burst or similar)
- Item deposited: Brief flash on the slot
- Quality: Brightness indicates quality (brighter = better), emissive glow for exceptional
- Durability: Red tint or indicator bar (not dimming, to avoid confusion with quality)
- Monster states: Gentle idle bob, more vigorous bob while working

---

Communication & Information:

You mentioned wanting to avoid menus and use in-world text like speech bubbles. Let me clarify:

1. Speech bubbles - What triggers these? Monster thoughts ("Need more silk!"), system messages ("Dispenser empty"), tutorial hints, or all of the above?

2. The two left panels - What info should each show?
   - Object info panel: When you hover/select an item, workshop, or dispenser - show its name, quality, durability, contents?
   - Monster skills panel: Current monster's ability scores, relevant skills, equipment?

3. Recipe selection - When you interact with a workshop to start recording, how do you pick a recipe? This seems like it needs *some* kind of menu. Small popup list? Or is there another way you're envisioning?

4. Monster selection - When switching monsters, same question - minimal popup list of your monsters?

5. Error/warning feedback - If something goes wrong (path blocked too long, dispenser empty), speech bubble? Sound implied by screen shake? Flash?
06:55 PM
1. all of the above -- 2. yes -- 3. true, how about a small popup list where you press a number to select something. -- 4. we can have one monster selection menu screen as an exception that shows when the game starts and when you select a new monster. -- 5. speech bubble and/or brief red color
06:59 PM
Perfect! Minimal UI philosophy with pragmatic exceptions:

Confirmed UI/Communication:
- Speech bubbles: Monster thoughts, system messages, tutorial hints - all in-world
- Object info panel (left): Name, quality, durability, contents for selected item/workshop/dispenser
- Monster skills panel (left): Ability scores, relevant skills, equipment for current monster
- Recipe selection: Small popup list, press number key to select (1-9 style)
- Monster selection: Dedicated menu screen (on game start + when switching monsters)
- Errors/warnings: Speech bubble and/or brief red flash

---

Economy & Progression:

Let me confirm how much of MonsterMakers' economy you want to bring over:

1. Renown system - Keep the scoring/renown economy where goods are delivered to drop-off points for renown? With share distribution to all contributors (producers, tool makers, transporters)?

2. Upkeep system - Monsters cost renown upkeep every 28 days? Or simplify this?

3. Cost multiplier - The MonsterMakers system where spending renown increases future costs? Keep or simplify?

4. Skill learning & forgetting - Keep the formulas where skills improve while working and slowly decay when not used?

5. Monster aging bonuses - The +1 to all stats after 30 days, +2 after 60 days?

6. Checkout system - In MonsterMakers, goods can be "checked out" by other players for 1 hour. Does this apply here, or is physical possession enough? (If I push your silk into my workshop, I'm using it?)
06:59 PM
1. yes, this is a key system. -- 2. for now let's keep upkeep. -- 3. keep -- 4. keep -- 5. keep -- 6. No, that one isn't needed, yes, physical possession is enough.
07:00 PM
Excellent! The economy is largely MonsterMakers-faithful, simplified by physical possession:

Confirmed Economy:
- Renown system: Full share distribution (producers, tool makers, transporters all get credit)
- Upkeep: 28-day cycle, monsters cost renown upkeep
- Cost multiplier: Spending increases future costs
- Skill learning/forgetting: Full formulas (INT, WIS, transferable skills affecting rates) [Editor's note: real-time decay removed; forgetting only occurs on task completion to match Django.]
- Monster aging: +1 stats at 30 days, +2 at 60 days
- No checkout system: Physical possession = ownership (push it, it's yours!)

---

Crafting & Workshops:

A few more specifics on the physical crafting:

1. Workshop size - How many cells does a workshop occupy? 2x2? 3x3? Variable by type?

2. Input slots - Are these visually distinct cells adjacent to/inside the workshop where you push items? How many slots per workshop (varies by recipe?)

3. Output slot - Same question - a specific cell where finished goods appear?

4. Workshop types - From MonsterMakers I see: Smelting, Blacksmithing, Tailoring, Weaving, Brewing, Baking, Lutherie, Furniture, etc. Keep all of these? Any to add/remove for the Sokoban context?

5. Tool requirements - Some recipes need tools (hammer, needle, etc.). Does the monster need to be *holding* the tool, or does it just need to be in their equipment/inventory?

6. Raw material gathering - In MonsterMakers, raw materials come from specific locations. Here, are there gathering spots in the world (push an empty container to a well, it fills with water)?
07:01 PM
1. I would like workshops to be something that you can walk INTO. normal size 4x4 or greater. -- 2. these are inside the workshop -- 3. also inside the workshop -- 4. keep, I worked hard on that tech tree :) you can find a full tech tree called tech_tree_two or similar in github/django -- 5. there should be special tool slots in the workshop. these just get used until they run out of durability. when a tool is gone, autorepeat will stop.  -- 6. yes, there are gathering spots in the world.
07:03 PM
I love the walk-into workshop concept! It makes the workshop feel like a real space you're working inside, not just a machine you interact with.

Let me find that tech tree:This is a beautifully detailed tech tree! Let me read more to understand the full scope:This is an incredibly rich tech tree! I can see textiles (silk, cotton, ramie, hemp, etc.), dyes (crimson, purple, indigo, various yellows and greens), chemistry (lye, vitriol, alum), and more. Let me get a sense of the full scope:Wow! This tech tree is massive - textiles, dyes, ceramics, pottery, metalworking, temple bells... I can see why you want to keep it. Let me check the end of the file to see what categories it covers:Got it! This is an incredibly comprehensive tech tree with ~80+ goods including:
- Textiles: Silk, cotton, ramie, hemp, velvetleaf, kudzu, thread, fabric
- Dyes: Crimson, pink, purple, indigo, yellow, green, brown (from natural sources)
- Ceramics: Clay, bricks, tiles, pottery, porcelain, glazes
- Metals: Ingots, nails, chisels, hammers, dies, temple bells
- Raw materials: Coal, coke, lime, various plants, minerals

---

Confirmed Workshop/Crafting Details:
- Workshops are 4x4+ walk-into spaces
- Input slots inside the workshop
- Output slots inside the workshop  
- Tool slots in the workshop (tools wear out, auto-repeat stops when depleted)
- Gathering spots in the world for raw materials
- Full MonsterMakers tech tree preserved (~80+ good types)

---

A few more questions to complete the picture:

Items & Grid:

1. Item visual representation - You said items are 1 cell (16x16 pixels with unifont). Do all items look like single unicode characters? Or can larger items (like a wagon) be multi-cell?

2. Stacking - Can multiple items occupy the same cell (a stack)? Or is it strictly one item per cell?

3. Dispensers - How do they work visually? Push into them to deposit, interact to withdraw? Or do they automatically dispense when you push "through" them?

Time & Persistence:

4. Game time scale - MonsterMakers has production times in minutes/hours. Should we use real-time, or compress time (e.g., 1 real second = 1 game minute)?

5. Offline progression - When a player logs out, do their monsters continue auto-repeating? Or do they pause until the player returns?
07:03 PM
1. Be careful about this one because 16x16 is actually 2x1 since a unicode character is 8x16 BUT there are double-length unicode characters. Most emoji type characters are double length, so items should be double length by default.  We should allow larger items to be multi-cell. We should just handle pushing items of different cell sizes with monsters of different sizes (even though that's not how sokoban works). This is so that we have the grid that pyunicodegame  expects. So when you push a normal item horizontally one cell, it will move one cell (even though it is two wide) and everything else will also move one cell at a time and account for varying sizes. -- 2. no stacking -- 3. Dispensers can only hold one type of item in them at a time. Push a like item in to deposit it (or any item if it's empty). OTherwise they show their topmost item and you can just push it right out of the dispenser. -- 4. You're right that the scale in monstermakers isn't quite right, let's try 1 real second = 30 game seconds but let's give ourselves a global constant so that we can tweak that. -- 5. they continue auto-repeating
07:13 PM
Excellent clarifications! This is a crucial detail about the grid system:

Confirmed Grid & Items:
- Cell = 8x16 pixels (one narrow unicode char width × unifont height)
- Standard items = 2 cells wide (16x16 pixels) using double-width unicode chars (emoji-style)
- Multi-cell items supported (wagons, large workshops, etc.)
- Push mechanics handle varying sizes - everything moves one cell at a time, collision detection accounts for item dimensions
- No stacking - one item per cell (or multi-cell item occupies its cells)

Confirmed Dispensers:
- Hold one item type at a time
- Push matching item in → deposits
- Push any item into empty dispenser → deposits
- Shows topmost item visually
- Push that visible item → it slides out

Confirmed Time:
- Time scale: 1 real second = 30 game seconds (configurable global constant)
- So a 60-minute MonsterMakers recipe = 2 real minutes
- Offline progression: YES - monsters continue auto-repeating while logged out

---

Final Feature Areas:

Multiplayer & Cooperation:

1. Shared vs owned items - If I push your silk, does it become mine? Or does ownership only transfer when used in crafting/scoring?

2. Shared workshops - Can multiple players' monsters use the same workshop? Or does each player/commune have their own facilities?

3. Trade/gifting - Any explicit trade mechanism, or is "push it to them" sufficient?

4. Chat/communication - Speech bubbles for player-to-player chat? Or some other system?

World Structure:

5. Delivery/scoring locations - Are these fixed buildings in specific towns where you push goods to "score" them for renown?

6. Wilderness travel - How does moving between zones work? Walk to the edge and transition? Explicit roads/paths?
07:13 PM
1. Yes, the only protection should be that another player can't push something you're actively pushing. It's beneficial to you for another player it use your items, so we should just encourage sharing. -- 2. It's beneficial to you for someone else to use your workshop as well, so same logic. "Sharing is good" is one of our mottos. -- 3. No explicit trading or gifting needed -- 4. Speech bubbles for player-to-player chat can just be documented as a nice-to-have for the future. Not needed now. -- 5. Yes, exactly. -- 6. Let's have explicit roads/paths that have a signpost saying where they go to.
07:21 PM
Perfect! "Sharing is good" - I love that philosophy. It creates natural cooperation without complex systems.

Confirmed Multiplayer:
- Item protection: Only rule is you can't push what someone else is actively pushing
- Shared workshops: Anyone can use any workshop (benefits the owner via shares!)
- No explicit trade: Physical possession is the mechanic
- Player chat: Future nice-to-have, not needed now

Confirmed World:
- Delivery locations: Fixed buildings in towns, push goods in to score for renown
- Zone transitions: Explicit roads/paths with signposts showing destination

---

Success Criteria:

Last question before I compile everything:

What does "done" look like for you?

1. MVP scope - What's the minimum that needs to work for a first playable version? (e.g., "One town, a few workshops, basic crafting loop, one monster type"?)

2. Quality bar - Polished with effects and animations from day one? Or functional first, polish later?

3. Any specific must-haves that we haven't covered? Or dealbreakers?
07:21 PM
1. That sounds good, but make sure the towns, workshops, crafting tree, and monster types are all pure data so that we can iterate on those often in the future easily. -- 2. effects and animations are one of my main concerns here because they will be key to the fun and playability. let's have as much polish as we can from day one with lots of pyunicode game effects and animations and close attension to UI and usability and feedback. Someone should be able to pick this up and play intuitively! -- 3. This is sounding right. Please make sure the frontend uses pyunicodegame, the backend uses gridtickmultiplayer with a game module that contains all the game logic we've talked about. No game logic client side! Remember players can just send anything over the websocket so make sure everything is completely server-authoritative.
07:28 PM
This is all crystal clear. Let me compile the feature breakdown:

---

Confirmed Architecture & Quality:
- Data-driven: Towns, workshops, tech tree, monster types all in pure data (easy iteration)
- Polish from day one: Heavy use of pyunicodegame effects, animations, particles - intuitive and fun
- Frontend: pyunicodegame client (rendering only, NO game logic)
- Backend: gridtickmultiplayer with custom game module (ALL logic server-side)
- Server-authoritative: Client sends intents, server validates everything, clients can't cheat

---

This is a substantial but achievable scope for a full crafting game. Does this breakdown feel right, or should I adjust anything?
07:28 PM
What about environment and world zones design?
07:43 PM
Great catch! Let me add that category:

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| Environment & World Zones | ~20 |

This should include:

- Zone types: Villages (with workshops/storage), Wilderness (dangerous/slow travel), Raw material areas (gathering spots)
- Zone layout: Grid-based terrain, walkable vs blocked cells, water/obstacles
- Regional specialization: Certain materials only in certain zones, certain workshops only in certain towns
- Roads/paths: Visual paths between zones, signposts with destination names

## Summary of Monster Workshop

A cooperative crafting game with a beautiful ASCII roguelike aesthetic where:

- Physical world - Everything exists as objects on a grid. Crafting = pushing ingredients. Sokoban IS the UI.
- pyunicodegame frontend - Particles, animations, bloom, lighting. Polish from day one.
- gridtickmultiplayer backend - Server-authoritative. Clients can't cheat.
- MonsterMakers economy - Full tech tree (~80+ goods), skills, renown, share distribution
- Recording/playback - Demonstrate a crafting run once, then auto-repeat
- Persistent cooperative world - See other players, share workshops, monsters work while offline

171 features across: Authentication, Monster System, World Navigation, Environment/Zones, Grid/Items, Workshops/Crafting, Visual Effects, Economy, Multiplayer, UI Panels, and Tech Tree Data.

The Continue to Project button should now appear. Click it to start the autonomous coding agent!

If you don't see the button: Type `/exit` or click Exit to Project in the header.

Important timing expectations:
- First session: The agent generates 171 features in the database. This takes several minutes.
- Subsequent sessions: Each coding iteration takes 5-15 minutes depending on complexity.
- Full app: Building all 171 features will take many hours across multiple sessions.

Controls:
- Press `Ctrl+C` to pause the agent at any time
- Run `start.bat` (Windows) or `./start.sh` (Mac/Linux) to resume where you left off
